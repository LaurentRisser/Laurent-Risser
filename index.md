Data Analyst/Scientist who takes pride in building models that translate data points into business insights. Built up my skills in diverse projects, now eager to apply the same knowledge to real-world business problems.

- Strong knowledge in Biology with M.Sc., Biology from Uppsala University.
- 2+ years of experience in statistical research.
- Strong understanding of statistics, machine learning, web scraping and regression and classification. Example packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, LGBM.
- Practical experience in predictive modelling (logistic regression, decision- tree), NLP and A/B testing.
- Proficient in statistical programming tools such as Python, R and SQL.
- Strong knowledge of Big Data tools (Spark, Hadoop), AWS cloud computing (EC2, EMR, S3, Redshift) and databases (Oracle, Redshift, MySQL).
- Experience with visualization tools (Tableau, Matplotlib, ggplot2).
- Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.
- Bilingual English and French.
- Author for Towards Data Science, Data Driven Investor and Analytics Vidhya on Medium

This portfolio is a compilation of projects which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

# My projects

## Get to know your friends with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Data Cleaning, Visualisation and Data Analysis
### [Medium Article - Get to know your friends with Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-to-know-your-friends-with-natural-language-processing-nlp-38a1f6e56e09) 

In this project I wanted to analyze a group chat on WhatsApp. I had to clean and manipulate the data first using REGEX package. Then I explored the dataset and I found some interesting results.

In this project I extracted the data using beautil soup through web scrapping and also cleaned and manipulated the data using Pandas.
Used web scrapping tool to extract data with Beautiful soup
- Cleaned and manipulated data sets using Pandas
- Interpreted results using pandas, matplot and statistical tests

## Social Analysis with Twitter Data
### Data Engineering and AWS
### [Medium Article - How to Create a Dataset with Twitter and Cloud Computing](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-dataset-with-twitter-and-cloud-computing-fcd82837d313?source=friends_link&sk=b56db9035ff3e59a68fbc19fbf211539) 

In this project I setup an ETL flow from the Twitter API to an S3 bucket. I used different services from AWS and I manipulated data by using Python and Shell languages.

## Predicting flight delays in the U.S.
### Data Analysis and Machine Learning
### [Medium Article - Will your flight be late?](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/will-your-flight-be-late-36818ffe52b3?source=friends_link&sk=b12b06c3463c125b1370650e8b52bc9f) 

Cleaned data sets on Python using Pandas
- Built linear and polynomial models using Scikit-Learn and Numpy
- Used Machine learning (Decision) to predict delays
- Visualized the data using Matplolib, Seaborn, Basemap
- Published an article on Medium
